### Project Title
Medical appointment No-shows analysis

### Project Description
This project is part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree where I looked at Medical appointment No-shows data to identify interesting trends. The dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. After data wrangling, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis to explore whether text message reminders, days between appointment scheduled day and actual appointment day, and age would affect appointment no-show rates.
 

### Files used
The CSV file used in this project was provided by Kaggle.
