### Project Title
Medical appointment No-shows analysis

### Project Description
This project is part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree where I wrangled and explored the Medical appointment No-shows dataset to identify interesting trends.
I examined whether text message reminders, days between appointment scheduled day and actual appointment day and patient age would affect medical appointment no-show rates.


### Files used
The CSV file used in this project was provided by Kaggle. <br />
The dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil.

### Credits
Special thanks to my Udacity teachers: Richard Kalehoff, Juno Lee, Karl Krueger, Josh Bernhard, Sebastian Thrun, Mike Yi, Daivid Venturi, Mat Leonard, Sam Nelson, Derek Steer and mentors: Raj V and George L as well as Udacity's project reviewers.
